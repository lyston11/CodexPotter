# codex-potter CLI

`codex-potter` is a TUI CLI that drives a **multi-round** Codex workflow using the **legacy**
`codex-tui` formatting pipeline (Markdown, TODO lists, diffs, exec output blocks, shimmer,
streaming, etc), powered by an external `codex app-server` process.

Unlike `codex exec`, this tool does **not** run codex-core directly — it launches an external
`codex app-server` process and renders the streamed events.

This is developer-facing documentation. Start at `docs/wiki/README.md` for the wiki index, and see
`core-architecture.md` for the end-to-end flow.

## Ownership

- Potter-specific: the `codex-potter` runner lives in `cli/` and owns the multi-round/project
  orchestration.
- Upstream-derived dependency: the spawned `codex app-server` process is part of the upstream Codex
  CLI, and most protocol/event semantics are defined by upstream.

## Workflow

1. Validates that a `codex` binary is available (via PATH, unless `--codex-bin` is provided).
2. Optionally recommends adding `.codexpotter/` to your global gitignore.
3. Prompts once for your project goal, then creates:
   - `.codexpotter/projects/YYYY/MM/DD/N/MAIN.md` (progress file)
   - a gitignored knowledge base directory (scratchpad for intermediate findings)
4. Runs up to N rounds (default 10). Each round:
   - starts a fresh `codex app-server` (one app-server thread + at least one `turn/start`; stream recovery may issue additional `turn/start` calls)
   - injects a fixed developer prompt pointing at the progress file
   - submits a fixed prompt: `Continue working according to the WORKFLOW_INSTRUCTIONS`
5. Stops early for the current project if the progress file front matter contains `finite_incantatem: true`
   (checked after each round; queued projects continue normally).

## CLI interface

```sh
codex-potter [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]
```

Options:

- `--codex-bin <path>`: Path to the `codex` binary to launch in app-server mode.
  - Also configurable via `CODEX_BIN` (defaults to `codex`).
- `--rounds <n>`: Number of turns to run (default: 10; must be >= 1).
  - For `resume`, this controls how many rounds are run when the last recorded round is complete.
    If the last recorded round is unfinished, the remaining budget is derived from the recorded
    `round_total` in `potter-rollout.jsonl`.
- `--sandbox <mode>`: Sandbox mode to request from Codex per turn.
  - One of: `default` (default), `workspace-write`, `read-only`, `danger-full-access`.
  - `default` matches `codex`'s default behavior: no `--sandbox` flag is passed to the app-server
    and the thread sandbox is left unspecified.
- `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`: Launch `codex app-server` in Codex's `--yolo` mode.
  - Alias: `--yolo`.

Examples:

```sh
codex-potter
codex-potter --codex-bin ./target/debug/codex
codex-potter --rounds 5
codex-potter --sandbox workspace-write
codex-potter --yolo
codex-potter resume
codex-potter resume 2026/02/01/1
codex-potter resume 2026/02/01/1 --yolo
codex-potter --yolo resume .codexpotter/projects/2026/02/01/1
```

## Commands

### `exec [PROMPT]`

Runs CodexPotter headlessly from the current working directory.

- Human-readable mode is the default: it prints an append-only transcript to stdout.
- `--json` switches stdout to the machine-readable JSONL event stream.
- If `PROMPT` is omitted, the prompt is read from stdin.
- Human-readable mode follows the same visibility policy as interactive verbosity:
  - default comes from `~/.codexpotter/config.toml` `[tui].verbosity`
  - when no verbosity is configured yet, it defaults to `minimal`
  - `--verbosity <minimal|simple>` overrides the configured value for this run only
- Human-readable mode does not reuse interactive folding/coalescing. It renders the same class of
  content, but every block is emitted append-only so the output can be piped safely.
- Color output follows terminal capability detection and respects `NO_COLOR` / `FORCE_COLOR`.

Examples:

```sh
codex-potter exec "Fix the failing test"
printf '%s\n' "Summarize this repository" | codex-potter exec
codex-potter exec --verbosity simple "Review the latest diff"
codex-potter exec --json "Fix the failing test"
```

### `resume [PROJECT_PATH]`

Replays a previous CodexPotter project (history-only) and then prompts for a follow-up action.

When `PROJECT_PATH` is omitted, `codex-potter` opens a full-screen picker UI listing resumable
projects under `<cwd>/.codexpotter/projects`:

- Navigate: `↑/↓` (or `Ctrl+P/Ctrl+N`), `PageUp/PageDown`
- Search: type to filter (matches user request, git branch, and project path), `Backspace` deletes
- Sort: `Tab` toggles `Updated` / `Created` (newest first)
- Confirm: `Enter` resumes the selected project
- Cancel: `Esc` starts a new project; `Ctrl+C` quits

At the moment the action picker has a single action:

- When the last recorded round is complete: `Iterate N more rounds`.
  - `N` is controlled by `--rounds` (default: 10).
- When the last recorded round is unfinished: `Continue & iterate M more rounds`.
  - `M` is derived from the recorded round budget in `potter-rollout.jsonl`.

When `PROJECT_PATH` is provided, it is resolved to a unique progress file (`.../MAIN.md`) using a
small candidate set:

- If `<PROJECT_PATH>` is an absolute path:
  - If it is a `MAIN.md` file, it is used as-is.
  - Otherwise it is treated as a project directory and `/MAIN.md` is appended.
- If `<PROJECT_PATH>` is a relative path, candidates are:
  - `<cwd>/.codexpotter/projects/<PROJECT_PATH>/MAIN.md`
  - `<cwd>/<PROJECT_PATH>/MAIN.md`

The resolver requires exactly one existing file. If no candidates exist it returns an error listing
the tried paths, and if multiple candidates exist it returns an ambiguity error listing all
candidates.

See `resume.md` for how replay works and which artifacts are required.

## Differences vs. `codex exec`

- `codex-potter` uses an external `codex app-server` process, while `codex exec` runs codex-core
  directly.
- `codex-potter exec --json` is still machine-readable, but `codex-potter exec` without `--json`
  is a potter-specific human transcript mode.
- This human transcript path intentionally follows codex-potter interactive verbosity visibility,
  while remaining append-only and never folding/coalescing earlier output.
- `codex-potter` renders rich TUI-formatted output (Markdown, diffs, exec blocks), while
  upstream `codex exec` uses a different human-output pipeline.

## Differences vs. `codex tui` (legacy)

- `codex tui` is interactive (composer, queueing, model selection, session selection, etc).
- `codex-potter` is multi-round: it prompts once, then runs a bounded number of turns and exits.

## Notes / gotchas

- Interactive `codex-potter` / `resume` requires a real TTY because it enters raw mode and listens
  for key events.
- `codex-potter exec` is designed for non-interactive use and can be piped into files or other
  programs.
- Prompt shortcuts (initial composer):
  - Up/Down to recall prompt history when the input is empty (stored in `~/.codexpotter/history.jsonl`, max 500 entries).
  - ctrl+g to open an external editor (requires `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR`), the same as codex.
- Thinking / reasoning events are intentionally filtered and not rendered.
- The global gitignore prompt can be disabled by setting
  `notice.hide_gitignore_prompt = true` in `~/.codexpotter/config.toml`.
- `--yolo` (`--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`) is unsafe: it disables Codex approvals and
  sandboxing, and `codex-potter` will also request `sandbox: "danger-full-access"` for the thread.
- You can also enable YOLO by default for all sessions via `~/.codexpotter/config.toml`:
  - `[potter].yolo = true` (or use `/yolo` in the TUI)
  - CLI `--yolo` still overrides the config (always enables YOLO for the current run)
- When YOLO is active, the prompt footer prefixes the status line with `▲YOLO`.
- The client requests `approvalPolicy: "never"` when starting the thread, and `codex-potter` is
  non-interactive. If an app-server requests an approval anyway, the current implementation will
  auto-accept to avoid hanging.
