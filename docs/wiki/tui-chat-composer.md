# TUI Chat Composer (State Machine Notes)

This document describes the behavior of the `ChatComposer` bottom-pane input state machine
(`tui/src/bottom_pane/chat_composer.rs`) as used by `codex-potter`.

For the broader round-renderer TUI design (output folding, token indicator, status header updates),
see `tui-design.md`. For the wiki index, see `README.md`.

For `@` file search (session orchestration + popup insertion), see `file-search.md`.

## Ownership

`ChatComposer` is upstream-derived (forked from the upstream Codex TUI) but used in a reduced
bottom pane tailored for `codex-potter` (prompt screen + round renderer). When changing
behavior, prefer staying close to upstream semantics unless a potter-specific constraint requires a
divergence.

## Responsibilities

The chat composer is responsible for:

- Editing the input buffer (`TextArea`) and keeping cursor/placeholder state consistent
- Routing key events to popups (for example file search) vs the main textarea
- Turning key streams into explicit paste operations when the terminal does not provide reliable
  bracketed-paste events (PasteBurst)
- Producing explicit outcomes for submission (`Submitted` / `Queued`) vs edits (`None`)
- Handling prompt-style history recall (Up/Down and Ctrl+P/Ctrl+N)

## Key Bindings (codex-potter)

High-level behavior when no popup is visible:

- `Enter`: attempts submission. When there is text, the composer returns
  `InputResult::Queued(text)` and clears the textarea.
  - `InputResult::Submitted` is currently not produced by any key binding in `codex-potter`
    (the variant remains for compatibility with the upstream Codex TUI).
- `Tab`: inserts a literal tab character (`\t`) into the textarea (does not submit).

When the file search popup is visible:

- `Enter` / `Tab`: accept the current selection (insert path)
- `Esc`: closes the popup without modifying text

## Key Routing

High-level flow:

1. `ChatComposer::handle_key_event`
2. If a popup is visible, route to a popup handler; otherwise route to
   `ChatComposer::handle_key_event_without_popup`
3. After handling any key, call `ChatComposer::sync_popups` so popup visibility matches the latest
   text/cursor state

History navigation is treated as a special mode: while browsing history, popups are suppressed so
continued Up/Down presses are not interrupted by popup focus changes.

## Submission vs Newline

The composer differentiates between:

- **Submit**: produce `InputResult::Submitted(text)` (or `Queued(text)` when queuing is enabled)
- **Insert newline**: insert `\n` into the textarea

For paste-like bursts, Enter is treated as a newline so the burst is captured as pasted text instead
of submitting mid-burst.

## Prompt History (Up/Down, Ctrl+P/Ctrl+N)

History navigation is only activated when it is unlikely the user is trying to move the cursor:

- If the input is empty: Up/Down navigates history.
- If the input is non-empty: Up/Down navigates history **only** when:
  - Cursor is at a buffer boundary (start or end), and
  - The current text matches the last history-filled value.

When a history entry is recalled, the composer replaces the entire content and moves the cursor to
the end of the buffer (shell-like editing).

If the user edits the recalled text or moves the cursor away from the start/end boundary, further
Up/Down behave as normal cursor movement until the input is empty again.

### Persistence (`codex-potter`)

Prompt history is stored at:

- `~/.codexpotter/history.jsonl`

Each entry is one JSON object per line:

- `{"ts": <unix_seconds>, "text": "<prompt>" }`

The file is truncated to the last 500 entries to keep reads/writes fast.

## Ctrl+C Clear Behavior

The composer provides `clear_for_ctrl_c()`:

- If the input is empty: returns `None` (caller decides whether to exit/cancel).
- If the input is non-empty:
  - Captures the current text
  - Captures placeholder element ranges + pending paste payloads (so large pastes can be restored)
  - Clears the composer
  - Resets history navigation state
  - Records the captured text into prompt history (so it can be recalled immediately via Up)
